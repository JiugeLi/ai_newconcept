We had and old musical instruments. 
It is called a  clavichord. 
It was made in Germany in 1681. 
Our clavichord is kept in living room .
It has belonged to our family for a long time. 
The instrument was bought by my grandfather many years ago. 
Recently,It was damaged by a visitor. 
He try to play jazz on it,
She strucked the keys too hard and two of the string were broken. 
My father was shocked. 
Now we are not allowed to touch it. 
It is been repaired by a friend of my fathers.
