# Lesson 14  Do you speak English?
## Did the young man speak English?

I had a amusing experience last year. 
After I had left a small village in South of France.
I drove on the next town.
On the way , a young man waved to me. 
I stopped ,and he ask me for a lift .
As soon as he has got into the car.
I said "good morning" to him in French.
And He replied in same language. 
A part of few words,I do not know any French at all.
Neither of us spoke during the journey. 
I had nearly reached to the town.
when the young man suddenly said very slowly,
"Do you speak English?"
As I soon learnt,he was English himself .
