# Do you speak English?
## Did the young man speak English? 

I had a amusing expoerience last year.
After I had left a small village in South of France.
I drove on to the next town.
On the way ,a young man waved to me .
I stopped ,and he ask me for a lift .
As soon as he has got into the car.
Apart from few words, I do not know any French at all.
Neither of us spoke during the journey. 
I had nearly reached to the town when the young man suddengly said "Do you speak English?" 
As I soon learnt,he was English himself.
