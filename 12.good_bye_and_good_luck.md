# Lesson 12: Goodbye and Good Luck

## First listen and then answer the question:
**Where is the captain going and how?**

Our neighbor, Captain Charles Alison, will sail from Portsmouth tomorrow.
We will meet him at the harbor early in the morning.
He will be in his small boat *Topsail*.

*Topsail* is a famous little boat.
It has sailed across the Atlantic many times.
Captain Charles Alison will set out at eight o'clock, so we will have plenty of time.
We will see his boat and then say goodbye to him.

He will be away for two months.
We are very proud of him.
He will take part in an important race across the Atlantic.
