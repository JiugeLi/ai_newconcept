Lesson 9: A Cold Welcome
what does a cold welcome refer to?
On Wedesday evening,we went to town hall. 
It was the last day of year, and large crowd of people had gathered under the town hall clock. 
It would strike twelve in twenty minutes time. 
Fifteen minutes passed and then at five to twelve,the clock stoped.
The big minute hand did not move. 
We waited and waited ,but nothing happened. 
Suddenly someone shouted: "It's two minutes past twelve,the clock had stopped!"
I looked at my watch,it was true.
The big clock refused to welcome the new year. 
At the moment ,everybody began to laugh and sing.
