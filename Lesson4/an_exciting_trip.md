# Lesson 4: An Exciting Trip 
## First listen and then answer the question. 
I have just received a letter from my brother, Tim. 
He is in Australia. 
He has been there for six months. 
Tim is an engineer. 
He is working for a big firm and has already visited a great number of different places in Australia.

He has just bought a new car in Australia and has gone to Alice Springs, a small town in the centre of Australia.

He will soon go to Darwin, from there he will fly to Perth. 
My brother has never been abroad before. So he will find this trip very exciting.
